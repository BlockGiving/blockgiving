Hi team BlockGiving!

Congratulations for winning a prize in the 2018 Colony Hackathon! 

I bet you’re wondering a bit more about how your submission was judged. If you remember the Judging Rubric, each project was graded along the criteria of Creativity, Design, Difficulty, and Functionality.

Judges based all of their scores on the rubric, but as it always goes with this sort of event, it was largely up to them how to apportion the ratings they were given. Some judges had the time to set up each and every project and inspect the code, others relied more on demo videos and presentation.

Judges were also asked to provide comment where appropriate. Here are some of the thoughts noted down during judging: 

these people have really thought this through.

impressive on all fronts

Design is okay.  Nice screen shots of the UI.  I liked the presentation and readme.  There are some design flaws that are problematic -- 1) verifying causes can be gamed especially if a validator / doer collude, 2) How do doer's cash out the cryptocurrency locally, 3) no method for surfacing / curating causes + doers (although that can be built offchain), 4) Could use more details around voting / reputation. 5) Relies on Civic / Uport for identity and I think this is unsolved 6) How do you protect against sybil attacks?

If it was super easy to give -- that would be awesome and I think many people would take advantage.  This idea has a ton of logistical / operations problems though.

Have seen decentralized giving in many forms.  Giveth is working on a platform.  They all come by some type of identity, reputation, verification and voting.  Very good idea to focus on transparency + ease of payment.
